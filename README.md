# XMage Cube Data

An R Shiny web application for Magic: The Gathering cube data analysis. Take a look at the final product at https://chimstead.shinyapps.io/cubedata/!
This repository contains the app's code (app.R in /apperino), supplemental .csv files (in /apperino), the data wrangling and pipelining files used to create those .csv files (deckFileMaker.py and make_all_data.R), and the raw data (in /dckfiles).
